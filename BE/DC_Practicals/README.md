# DC Practicals

1. The aim of this experiment is to design and implement a distributed application using Remote Procedure Call (RPC) for remote computation. Specifically, the experiment focuses on  creating a client-server architecture where the client submits an integer value to the server, which then calculates the factorial of the given integer and returns the result to the client program.

2. The aim of this experiment is to design and implement a distributed application using Remote Method Invocation (RMI) for remote computation. Specifically, the experiment focuses on creating a client-server architecture where the client submits two strings to the server, and the server returns the concatenation of the given strings.

3. To design and develop a distributed Hotel booking application using Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI). The system consists of a hotel server managing room booking information and client machines enabling customers to book or cancel room bookings.

4. The aim of this experiment is to apply Neural Style Transfer (NST) using deep learning techniques to generate artistic images by combining the content of a given image with the style of another image.
